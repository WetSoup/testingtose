  <h1>Who We Are and Why We "Danced The Night Away"</h1>
  <p>At Whitney High School, there is a pinch of students in Dance I. To be frank with you, I don't believe there is an advanced dance class (although it's listed as one of the school courses). As small as our class is, we had a blast and found learning easy as we had one another. We couldn't have been happier with the Barbie movie choreography of "Dance the Night Away" by Dua Lipa. This song was nothing short of ideal for us; from its disco vibe to its sensuality, it was ideal for an ecstatic class like ours. Ms. Improta, our teacher, took inspiration from the original dance and put her own flair into it. She asked for our feedback and we always agreed with her creative suggestions. Learning the dance was superb, but dancing in front of the entire school was amazing to an indescribable level.</p>
